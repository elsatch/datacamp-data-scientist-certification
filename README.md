# Datacamp Data Scientist Certification (2022)

All my notes, code samples and tips to prepare for Datacamp's Data Scientist Certification (2022 edition).

In this new updated edition of the certification, instead of 5 timed assessments, you will be evaluated in two exams.

- DS101: Exploratory Analysis, Statistical Experimentation, and Data Management in Python
- DS201: Data Management in SQL; Modeling and Programming in Python

For a complete description of all the topics evaluated, please refer to the [official documentation](https://certification2022-docs.datacamp.com/certification-2022/data-scientist-professional)

Also note that Datacamp has recently changed the names of some of these assesments, so you might find them under different names.
